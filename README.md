## Self-hosting

FishBB is intended to require a minimal amount of infrastructure and
administration for self-hosting. Please reach out if you are interested in
running your own instance!

### Configuration

TODO

**robots.txt** -- edit the views/robots.txt file, or, if you're running this service behind a reverse proxy, use that as well.


### Google Signup

Optional Google Signup TODO

If you are following along, anti-spam is NOT to the point where open signups
are a good idea. Don't try to self-host with open signups yet

## Open Source
