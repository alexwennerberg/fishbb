Setup fishbb.org (cloud provider)

minor/bugs:
permissions on forums don't actually work. can I simplify permissions? 
Role and Active also cached? or make "active" a role...

boring stuff:
csrf doesnt actually work
rate limit registration: 5 accounts per IP per day
better error handling on login
better ux for account creation
links on home and thread list should go to the post ( BETTER LINK  TO POST )
-> create a getpost query and parameterize it 
finish up oauth integration
implement change password / reset password
hide CSRF key from config

----- alpha waterline ----- (may push lower to get something more complete out)
