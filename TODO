Setup fishbb.org (cloud provider)

minor/bugs:

boring stuff:
rate limit registration
better error handling on login
better ux for account creation
links on home and thread list should go to the post ( BETTER LINK  TO POST )
-> create a getpost query and parameterize it 
finish up oauth integration
implement change password / reset password
hide CSRF key from config

----- alpha waterline ----- (may push lower to get something more complete out)

# DEFINITELY
block renaming of forum
IP blocking / other antispam
2fa  pquerna/otp
Delete account: dont delete posts, replace with "(deleted)"?
get anti spam good enough for open signups
Archive forums
distinguish notfound db error from other errors
login package should merge
JSON API
flash on inactive account

# MAYBE 
Delete own account
Split out read and write permissions
reporting system
panics -> log.Fatal
better db init / signal handling
Microformats
language selection and localization

OPS/DEPLOY:
RRDtool integration / metrics
