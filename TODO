Setup fishbb.org (cloud provider)

minor/bugs:

boring stuff:
rate limit registration: 5 accounts per IP per day
finish up oauth integration

----- alpha waterline ----- (may push lower to get something more complete out)

# DEFINITELY
make Post Slug faster / cleaner with a view or something
csrf doesnt actually work? <--- Why did I write this
2fa pquerna/otp
implement change password 
implement reset password
IP blocking / other antispam
Delete account: dont delete posts, replace with "(deleted)"?
get anti spam good enough for open signups
distinguish notfound db error from other errors
Forum sections
login package should merge
JSON API

# MAYBE 
Delete own account
reporting system
panics -> log.Fatal
better db init / signal handling
Microformats
language selection and localization

OPS/DEPLOY:
RRDtool integration / metrics
