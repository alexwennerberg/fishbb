# how to code on this repo
- KISS is important
- appreciate craft. move slowly and fix things. It can be a bit of a challenge to prompt AI to write good code, sometimes it makes a mess. But I definitely incorporate agentic coding into some tasks
- flat abstractions. anti-DRY, feel free to repeat yourself as needed, find the
  simplest solution to the problem at hand
- minimize dependencies when possible 
- everything should live in the binary or in the sqlite database
- no need for unit tests
